downloaded 'Gsap cdn' for smooth scorlling animations.
and also pasted the 'scroll trigger' , which is a plugin of gsap .

use gsap like: gsap.to("#nav",{
    // write any property yiu want to give to nav
    //or we can access any css property but used camil cases instead of '-' in between
    used scrollTrigger{
        //any property 
    }
})
